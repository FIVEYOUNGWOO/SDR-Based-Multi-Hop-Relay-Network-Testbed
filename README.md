## SDR-Based-Relay-Network-Testbed

Implementation of NI-USRP2921, 2932-based robust multi-hop relay testbed in Labivew NXG 5.0.

However, since this project is related to KIOST, I didn't attach my testbed codes.

## Requirements
- (HW) NI-USRP2921, 2932
- (HW) NETGEAR switch hub
- (HW) Ethernet cat5 cable
- (SW) Labview 2021 or 2022
